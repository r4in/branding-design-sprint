#The Vector Pushers

There are some cases wherein the **client already has made a sketch of his own** or by another designer he previously hired. And what would probably happen is they want you to vectorize it.

Sure there is no problem with vectorizing it (You're and expert) But the problem is the set of problem it includes like:

- You have no understanding of the buisiness, the audience, the brand and its purpose.

- You have no objectives & goals of the project to effectively create effective design decisions

Unless of course thats perfectly fine with you, you can get away with that by replying honestly:

>“If you just want just vectorize your sketch, hire a design student. They will do it well and it won’t cost you too much. But if you would like to hire me for this project, we will follow the complete logo design process. Of course, I will remember your sketch and will try to work on it. For now, without knowing all the project details, I cannot promise that it will be the best solution in your case and I will come up with other concepts.”

If it's cool with the client, then you have established your credebility as a designer. If not, then the client isn't just the right fit for you.
