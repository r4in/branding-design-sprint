So, how do we go about this? You might be thinking, it’s quite simple like:
- talk to the client, ask them what they want, 
- provide 3 mockups
- ship and profit!

But that’s just not usually the case. You need to dig deeper and understand their objectives & goals, and make sure you’re doing a good job at explaining why you have the right solution (And not the WordArt they mocked up in Word)* You need to present the concept, the rationale and the theory behind it. Guessing is a recipe for disaster. What we’re doing is creating a design process to ensure everyone in the team, including the stakeholders are steering the design in the right direction.

So we’re gonna be crafting a great branding workflow!

*No offense to WordArt, I love WordArt!
