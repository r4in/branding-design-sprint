### Intro
So, how do we go about this? You might be thinking, it’s quite simple like:
- Talk to the client, ask them what they want.
- Send 3 mockups and pray one gets approved.
- Profit! (Which happens in an alternate universe, far, far away)

But that’s not what always happen. You'll need to dig deeper, understand their objectives & goals, take them from point A to point B. You need to present the concept, rationale and theory behind it. Guessing is a recipe for disaster. What we’re doing is creating a design process to ensure everyone in the team, including the stakeholders are steering the design in the right direction.

So let's go craft a great branding workflow!
