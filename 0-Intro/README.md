# Intro

Before we start doing the sprints, I think we first need to establish what it is that we're trying to build. Like a crash course in branding! So, what exactly is branding?


## Branding Mythology
Okay, let's do an activity. Check the boxes below which you think is branding:

Branding is the Logo (Insignia, Symbol, Icon, ect.)
Branding is an Identity (Brandbooks, Styleguides)
Branding is the Actual Product

If you answered yes to all of the above, congratulations! - It's incorrect! Confused? Don't worry, I was also there before.

### What is a Brand?
"A brand is a person's gut feeling about a product, service or company"
- The Brand Gap, Marty Neumeier

That's it. But why? It makes sense because what others feel about your product or service is defined by people, and not what the market or advertising agencies say. 

"It's not what *you* say it is. It's what *they* say it is"

You can't control the process, but you can surely influence it.

### So, What are we exactly doing?
What we're doing is actually just a small chunk of the whole brand. We're basically laying down the foundation of developing the brand in an attempt of visually representing what the stakeholders imagine their company/product to be. Our mission as brand designers is to transform their ideas into something tangible.

### So, we're doing a logo right?
"The term *Logo*, short for Logotype, design-speak for a *trademark* made from a custom-lettered word (Logos is Greek for Word)"

Therefore,

" A trademark can be a logo, symbol, monogram, emblem or other graphic dvice. *A trademark is not the brand itself. It's merely a symbol for it.*"
- The Futur, Chris Do
