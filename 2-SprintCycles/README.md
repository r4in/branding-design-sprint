A sprint deliverable is the creative presentation of your concepts and progress, shipped every end of the work week (in our case, fridays!). One sprint cycle is equivalent to 5 days. The number of sprint cycles for every client may slightly vary due to the unique nature of the different problems you need to solve - there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this one. But what we do have, is a collection of guidelines for every level of the branding sprint cycle.
