# Hey Folks! 

Congratulations on landing that branding project. So, what's next? You sure are confident with your killer-design skills, but what do you say when your client asks you for your process? Or what if you run into problems materializing what they want & need? Well, you're in luck! 

This guide aims to give you a smooth & silky process, from understanding their branding position to getting client approval, arriving to that nice sign off*.

*I do not guarantee a 100% silky smooth run on your project. Shampoos falsely advertise that too.
