# Kickoff Meeting
Welcome to our Branding Kickoff Meeting!

### Setting the Kickoff Meeting
Once the contract has been sealed, it’s time to get working! Setup a kickoff meeting with the entire team and the stakeholders. It is very important that the stakeholders are present during this kickoff as they ultimately steer the company, along with their vision for it. Establish who is the decision maker (usually the CEO), who would give the final word based on the aggregated feedback with fellow stakeholders. I wrote a nice guide on how to do Kickoff Meetings here.
