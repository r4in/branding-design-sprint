# Design is a Job

I just want to broaden your perspective with this:

>**We are not artists.** We donâ€™t express ourselves by designing things. _We are passionate about design, but for us design is not just a passion. And it is definitely not a hobby. -Iryna Nezhynska_

I know there's a lot of interconnection and relation between art & design, because art is a medium by which we inspire ouselves to do creative work. And design is an objective approach of utilizing this creativity we posess. Despite almost being used interchangably by everyone who isn't familar in this field of subject, there is actually a fine line drawn between the two. 

>_Art and Design are completely different. Design is about making solutions, art is about making questions. In art you can make anything that doesn't make sense - and that's okay. But in design, you need to make sense. - John Maeda_

And that's perfectly okay, so don't take it in a negative way :)

Always listen to the stakeholder's requirements, and in doing so, you are actually solving a problem. **Design thinking is problem solving through visual communication.**

Ultimately, the goal of design is help our clients businesses. And everything is actually designed, only some things are designed better.
