# Starting the Kickoff
Here are a couple of things you need to prepare for the kickoff:

### Leveling the Field
Not everyone in the room knows about you, your work, or even your company. You need to let them know what you are bringing to the table. Skip all the ~~mission-vision bullcrap~~. What you really need to show is who you are and what you are capable of. A brief intro of your company and the services you offer to your top clients is cool, but most importantly is showing your portfolio.

### Explain Your Design Workflow
Assuming that you've never worked before with the client, you need to set the tone of how you work - this way, as early in the beginning expectations are already set and no mismatched client expectations happen. (You don't want to go into the rabbit hole of endless client revisions) When they hire you, _they are hiring your workflow_  as well. 

You can refer to the **Branding Workflow Guide** we have.
